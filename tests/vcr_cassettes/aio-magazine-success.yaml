        are in year 2035 on the Tinos planet, colonized 300 years before by some earthlings.
        With only half of Earth''s oxygen concentration and with cold arctic conditions
        over most of Tinos, the human beings are forced to wear a life support apparatus
        that supplies the oxygen necessary for survival. The black market in such
        apparatuses is a flourishing business in the criminal world of Junk City.
        Blue, the protagonist, is in desperate need of a life support system after
        being mugged, but an unscrupulous bunch of criminals cheat him of his money
        and leave him with an outdated model with an old AI. He is tricked by the
        head of the police, Weiser, into a committing murder, and is then killed himself.
        The AI, called Fatso, decides to save his life, and gives him a new artificial
