        all of the Clow Cards recaptured and changed into her own Sakura Cards, Sakura
        Kinomoto now enters her first year at Tomoeda Middle School. After her initial
        day of classes, Sakura reunites with her love Shaoran Li, who informs her
        that he is permanently moving back to Tomoeda. Much to her surprise, it even
        turns out that Shaoran will attend the same school and it seems as if Sakura''s
        life is heading in all the right directions.\n\nHowever, when Sakura goes
        to sleep, she encounters in her dream a mysterious cloaked figure and finds
        herself surrounded by transparent cards. Waking up in fear, Sakura is shocked
        to see her dream has come true, with the Sakura Cards having turned clear.
        Continued dreamlike encounters with the unknown enemy and her gaining a new
        magical key sets the stage for Cardcaptor Sakura''s latest adventure!\n\n[Written
