        ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures
        called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls.
        What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh
        is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure
        their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers,
        resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However,
        that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach
        the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against
        the man-eating abominations.\r\n\r\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss
        at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to
        their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit
        that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls.
        Based on Hajime Isayama''s award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows
        Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend
        Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover
        a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\r\n\r\n[Written

        the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and a massive
        online role-playing game called Sword Art Online (SAO) is launched. With the
        aid of \"NerveGear\" technology, players can control their avatars within
        the game using nothing but their own thoughts.\r\n\r\nKazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed
        \"Kirito,\" is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the
        first shipment of the game. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand
        others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic
        medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events,
        the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game''s creator has trapped
        them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game.\r\n\r\nIn
        order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with
        his fellow players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki,
        who commands the leading group attempting to escape from the ruthless game.
        To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they
        die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality,
        fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.\r\n\r\n[Written
