        equivalent to \"The Partridge Family\" and you''ll get a good feel for this
        show''s atmosphere. Don''t expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu
        action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to
        the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic
        art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find
        the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings
        grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\"
        by adults. \r\n\r\n(Source: AniDB)","type":"TV","airing_start":"1969-10-05T09:30:00+00:00","episodes":null,"members":5422,"genres":[{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice
