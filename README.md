For `v3`, see [v3](./v3)

`v4` is an alpha -- it uses the [`openapi-python-client`](https://github.com/openapi-generators/openapi-python-client) to automatically generate code/models and responses. If you have any issues with the generated, feel free to open an issue here -- though it will likely require a change to the [`openapi schema`](https://github.com/jikan-me/jikan-rest/blob/master/storage/api-docs/api-docs.json)
